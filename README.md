# Profile Website

Minimal, Apple-inspired profile site with an OLED-black look, subtle South Indian touch, and smooth, performant animations.

## Features

- OLED-black, Apple-like design with clean typography
- Off-canvas sidebar menu with overlay and ESC to close
- Smooth scrolling and reveal-on-scroll animations
- Hero background: p5.js Concentric Wavy Rings (white, subtle, perf-aware)
- Minimalist “sleeping cat” SVG in the top-right background (hover: one eye; click: wake, then sleep)
- Performance-friendly: respects reduced-motion, enables a low-power mode on slower devices
- Responsive layout

## Getting started

1) Download/clone the repo
2) Open `index.html` in your browser

No build step required.
